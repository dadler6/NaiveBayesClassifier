# NaiveBayesClassifier

This is my own implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier for text data, purely for learning purposes.  The file folder structure is as follows:

**src**
The code for the naive bayes classifier implementation.

src/NaiveBayesClassifeir.py:
The Naive Bayes classifier.  It has two main functions, train and predict.  See implementation notes for more details.

**examples**
Examples of running the various files in src.

**data**
Data for the various test cases I'm developing.

**tests**
Test cases of the src code.

tests/test\_NaiveBayesClassifier.py:
Test cases for the Naive Bayes Classifier function.  Tests were built using pytest, and can be run within the command *pytest test\_NaiveBayesClassifier.py*.
